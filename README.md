# Statistical Repository ST
**Statistical Repository README**

Welcome to the ST, Statistical Repository! This repository contains implementations and tools related to various statistical methods and distributions. Below is a brief overview of the contents of this repository:

1. **Bayesian Estimation for Topp-Leone Distribution**:
   - Description: This module focuses on Bayesian estimation techniques applied to the Topp-Leone distribution. The Topp-Leone distribution is commonly used in reliability analysis and survival modeling.
   - Usage: Refer to the documentation or code comments for instructions on how to use Bayesian estimation for the Topp-Leone distribution.

2. **LGBootStrapControlChart**:
   - Description: LGBootStrapControlChart is a statistical method/tool related to bootstrap resampling techniques applied to control charts. Bootstrap resampling is a statistical technique used for estimating the distribution of a statistic by repeatedly resampling the original dataset with replacement. Control charts are used in statistical process control to monitor processes over time.
   - Usage: Consult the documentation or code comments for guidance on implementing LGBootStrapControlChart for control chart analysis.

3. **X G D distribution**:
   - Description: X G D distribution likely refers to a specific probability distribution, although further context is needed to provide a precise description. It might be associated with distributions like the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, commonly used to model extreme events or values in various fields such as hydrology and finance.
   - Usage: Explore the documentation or code comments for insights into utilizing the X G D distribution in statistical analysis.

Feel free to explore the repository, review the documentation, and utilize the provided implementations for your statistical analysis needs. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out to the repository maintainers.

Happy analyzing!
