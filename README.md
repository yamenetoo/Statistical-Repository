# Statistical Repository 


Welcome to the ST, Statistical Repository! This repository contains implementations and tools related to various statistical methods and distributions. Below is a brief overview of the contents of this repository:

1. **Bayesian Estimation for Topp-Leone Distribution**:
   - Description: This module focuses on Bayesian estimation techniques applied to the Topp-Leone distribution. The Topp-Leone distribution is commonly used in reliability analysis and survival modeling.
   - Usage: Refer to the documentation or code comments for instructions on how to use Bayesian estimation for the Topp-Leone distribution.

2. **LGBootStrapControlChart**:
   - Description: LGBootStrapControlChart is a statistical method/tool related to bootstrap resampling techniques applied to control charts. Bootstrap resampling is a statistical technique used for estimating the distribution of a statistic by repeatedly resampling the original dataset with replacement. Control charts are used in statistical process control to monitor processes over time.
   - Usage: Consult the documentation or code comments for guidance on implementing LGBootStrapControlChart for control chart analysis.

3. **X G D distribution**:
   - Description: X G D distribution  refers to a specific probability distribution, It  associated with distributions like the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, commonly used to model extreme events or values in various fields such as hydrology and finance.
   - Usage: Explore the documentation or code comments for insights into utilizing the X G D distribution in statistical analysis.

 

Happy analyzing!
