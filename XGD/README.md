**XGD Distribution**

Welcome to the XGD (XGamma Distribution) module! This module provides an implementation of the XGamma distribution, which is a mixture distribution combining features of the gamma and exponential distributions.

**Overview:**

The XGamma distribution is a probability distribution that combines characteristics of both the gamma and exponential distributions. It is particularly useful for modeling data that exhibits behavior similar to both distributions.

**Key Features:**

1. **Mixture Distribution:** The XGamma distribution is a mixture of the gamma and exponential distributions, allowing it to capture a wider range of data patterns than either distribution alone.

2. **Flexible Parameterization:** The distribution offers flexible parameterization to accommodate different data sets and modeling requirements.
